## Scorecards site deployment

Changes made to the netlify.toml file should be committed and Netlify will know right away and make changes to the server for you.

Any changes to the code will be built by netlify automatically and statically generated so you don't do anything at all.

Make sure you make use of deploy previews in GitHub when making changes to the codebase. The PR's you create will have the deploy previews built into GitHub within the PR which should appear.
