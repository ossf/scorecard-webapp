Security Scorecards can be used in a couple of different ways:

1. Run automatically on code you own **using the GitHub Action**
2. Run manually on your (or somebody else’s) project **via the Command Line**

### Using the GitHub Action

<section class="highlight-section">

### Install time: <10 mins

Use the action to automatically scan any code updates for security vulnerabilities. Any time someone commits a change, the action will automatically check the repo and alert you (and other maintainers) if there are problems.

  </iframe>

</details>

### Installation instructions

1. You need to own the repository you are installing the action to, or have admin rights to it.
2. [Authenticate](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action#authentication) your access to the repository with a Personal Access Token
3. Add Security Scorecards to your [codescanning suite](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action#workflow-setup) inside GitHub using the link below:

### Using the CLI

<section class="highlight-section">

### Install time: <10mins

You can use Security Scorecards on the Command Line. This enables you to:

- Check someone else’s repository
- Select which checks you want to run
- Control how detailed your results are

</details>

### Install and run

1. Create a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with 'public_repo' scope. Store the token somewhere safe.
2. Choose a language-specific quick start below, or refer to our [detailed instructions](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard#scorecards-command-line-interface)

<code-group>

  <code-block title="Homebrew" active>

```bash
# For posix platforms, e.g. linux, mac:
export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=<your access token>

# For windows:
set GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=<your access token>

brew install scorecard

scorecard --repo=<your choice of repo e.g. github.com/ossf-tests/scorecard-check-branch-protection-e2e>
```

  </code-block>

  <code-block title="Docker">

```bash
docker run -e GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=<your access token> gcr.io/openssf/scorecard:stable --repo=<your choice of repo e.g. github.com/ossf-tests/scorecard-check-branch-protection-e2e>
```

  </code-block>

  <code-block title="Nix">

```bash
export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=<your access token>

nix-shell -p nixpkgs.scorecard

scorecard --repo=<your choice of repo e.g. github.com/ossf-tests/scorecard-check-branch-protection-e2e>
```

  </code-block>

### The problem

By some estimates\* 84% of all codebases have at least one vulnerability, with an average of 158 per codebase. The majority have been in the code for more than 2 years and have documented solutions available.

Even in large tech companies, the tedious process of reviewing code for vulnerabilities falls down the priority list, and there is little insight into known vulnerabilities and solutions that companies can draw on.

That’s where Security Scorecards is helping. Its focus is to understand the security posture of a project and assess the risks that dependencies introduce.

\*[Open Source Security and Risk Analysis Report](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/resources/analyst-reports/open-source-security-risk-analysis.html?intcmp=sig-blog-ossra1) (Synopsys, 2021)

### What is Security Scorecards?

##### Security Scorecards assesses open source projects for security risks through a series of automated checks

It was created by OSS developers to help improve the health of critical projects that the community depends on.

You can use it to proactively assess and make informed decisions about accepting security risks within your codebase. You can also use the tool to evaluate other projects and dependencies, and work with maintainers to improve codebases you might want to integrate.

Security Scorecards help you enforce best practices that can guard against:

<br/>

### How it works

Security Scorecards checks for vulnerabilities affecting different parts of the software supply chain including **source code**, **build**, **dependencies**, **testing**, and project **maintenance**.

Each automated check returns a **score out of 10** and a **risk level**. The risk level **adds a weighting** to the score, and this weighting is compiled into a single, **aggregate score**. This score helps give a sense of the overall security posture of a project.

Alongside the scores, the tool provides remediation prompts to help you **fix problems** and strengthen your development practices.

<br/>

### The checks

##### The checks collect together security best practises and industry standards

The riskiness of each vulnerability is based on how easy it is to exploit. For example if something can be exploited via a pull request, we consider that a high risk. There are currently 18 checks made across 3 themes: holistic security practises, source code risk assessment and build process risk assessment.

You can learn more about the scoring criteria, risks, and remediation suggestions for each check in the [detailed documentation](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md).

> Machine checkable properties are an essential part of a sound security process. That’s why we have incorporated Security Scorecards into our dependency acceptance criteria.
<div class="text-right mb-60"><cite>Harvey Tuch, <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a></cite></div>

### Use cases

##### Security Scorecards reduces the effort required to continually evaluate changing packages when maintaining a project’s supply chain

#### For individual maintainers

Security Scorecards is helpful as a pre-launch security checker for a new OSS project or to help to plan improvements to an existing one. If a project is well maintained, it’s more likely to be used by others instead of an alternative. It can also be used to check a new dependency being added to a project, so a maintainer can make an informed decision about the risk of doing so.

#### For an organisation

Security Scorecards can be included in the continuous integration/continuous deployment processes using the GitHub action and run by default on pull requests.

#### For consumers

Security Scorecards helps to make informed decisions about security risks and vulnerabilities. Using the public data, it is also possible to evaluate the security posture of over 1 million of the most used OSS projects.

Security Scorecards is being [developed and facilitated by contributors](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/graphs/contributors) from across the OSS ecosystem.

We're part of the [Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)](https://openssf.org), a cross-industry collaboration that brings together OSS security initiatives under one foundation and seeks to improve the security of OSS by building a broader community, targeted initiatives, and best practises.

OpenSSF launched Security Scorecards in November 2020 with the intention of auto-generating a “security score” for open source projects to help users as they decide the trust, risk, and security posture for their use case.
